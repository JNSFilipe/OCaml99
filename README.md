# OCaml99

This repo contains my solutions to the 99 problems found [here](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html), in an attempt to learn OCaml.

## Running

After downloading the repo, cd into it and install [Alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest?tab=readme-ov-file#using-alcotest-with-opam-and-dune) using:

```
opam install --deps-only --with-test .
```
After that, just run `dune runtest`.
